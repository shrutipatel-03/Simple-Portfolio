*COMPANY*: CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS

*NAME*: PATEL SHRUTI

*INTERN ID*: COD123

*DOMAIN*: FRONT END DEVELOPMENT

*DURATION*: 4 WEEKS

*MENTOR*: NEELA SANTOSH

*Task Description: Personal Portfolio Webpage
The objective of this task is to design and develop a responsive single-page personal portfolio website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This portfolio will serve as a digital resume for showcasing a developerâ€™s skills, projects, and contact information in a professional and visually appealing manner.

The webpage includes a fixed header with smooth-scrolling navigation links that direct users to different sections of the page: Home, About, Projects, and Contact. The Home section introduces the developer with a headline and brief description. The About section provides a personal summary and technical background. The Projects section showcases sample projects in a responsive grid layout with hover animations. The Contact section features a simple contact form for communication.

The design is made fully responsive using media queries and a mobile-friendly navigation menu that toggles on smaller screens. Modern CSS techniques such as flexbox, grid, and transitions are used for layout and interactivity, while JavaScript enables smooth scrolling and responsive menu toggling.

This task not only helps in building front-end skills but also prepares developers for creating personal portfolios required for internships, job applications, or freelancing. Upon successful completion of this task as part of the CodTech Internship, a completion certificate will be awarded at the end of the internship.*
